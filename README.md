## Topic of project

Single-page web application for course registration using React.js.

The goal of the project is to create a practical/real-world application. We all use or have used the online course registration tool as students. I believe the time is right to build one. Students can select from a list of available courses in this application, browse through each course, see the detailed information, add the course to their cart, and complete the registration process. The app will have multiple pages for courses cart page and registered courses page etc,. With this project, we can demonstrate what we’ve learned about React.js and how to use concepts like creating react components and using react router to create single-page web apps.

### Features:

Browse course list, 
Course detail page, 
Add course to cart, 
Check cart items, 
Complete course registration
